# E-commerce Website Data Scraping and Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to perform web scraping on an e-commerce website (e.g., Amazon), followed by data cleaning and visualization using popular Python libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Usage

1. **Web Scraping (`webscrapping.ipynb`):** The `webscrapping.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to scrape product information from an e-commerce website (e.g., Amazon). Open the notebook using Jupyter and follow the instructions to execute each cell.

2. **Data Cleaning (`webscrapping.ipynb`):** The `webscrapping.ipynb` notebook showcases the process of cleaning the scraped data. It covers tasks like handling missing values, formatting columns, and preparing the data for visualization.

3. **Data Visualization (`webscrapping.ipynb`):** The `webscrapping.ipynb` notebook illustrates various data visualization techniques using Matplotlib. It presents insights and trends based on the cleaned e-commerce data.
